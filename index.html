      <q>Fantastic fun day out for the whole family. Katy and Mick are brilliant giving basic understandable instructions for first timers and technique advice as you improve. Having never shot an arrow before my first visit I left total impressed with how many arrows were hitting the target thanks to Katy. I have booked sessions for my husband and myself, and for groups of 15 aged from 5 years and up. Katy is great at keeping it interesting making sure even in a large group of mixed experience everyone is challenged and the time flys in. Looking forward to my next visit</q><br>Donna,

            <p>Hiya, I'm Katy! I started Mourne Archery Centre in 2009 because I wanted to provide a service to my local community and I knew archery would be a great way to do that. I am passionate about keeping our sport accessible and affordable,
                        about providing a space for kids and adults to learn new skills and meet new people.  I'd love to have you down to the barn so I could show how we build community and have a lot of fun in the process.</p>

            <p>The centre is based in a barn in the middle of Maghera, Co. Down - really close to Newcastle.  Our normal sessions run for 3 hours with a variety of fun games ranging from traditional target shooting to popping balloons.  We can have 15 shooters on the line at any one point and for larger groups we can take turns.</p>

      <q>Really can't rate this place highly enough. 
    Five adults and a rather excited wee dog dropped by for a bit of fun, and boy we weren't disappointed. Katy and her Dad Michael were absolutely superb. From instructions and tips and some great games, it was 3 hours of brilliant fun. The competitive streak in me never appeared once :) Seriously ? We couldn't contain ourselves. 
    Brendan kept our wee terrier entertained while we cracked on with the serious business of beating each other. A cup of coffee and a few biscuits in between games made for a great afternoon's craic.
    Will we be back ? With bells on </q>

    I can honestly say that every time that we visit we are treated like royalty. Nothing is ever a problem and Katy and her team are professional at all times. We visited yesterday for my sons 14th birthday. Katy accommodated us at short notice and the kids and adult had a great time. Can I thank her son for his great company while I sat and watched. Hopefully we will see you again soon :)</q><br>Julie,

      <q>I spent my Easter Monday at Mourne Archery Centre and I loved it. The centre is run by a lovely woman called Katy, who immediately makes you feel at ease with her wit and patience. The activity includes three hours of fun, learning how to shoot as well as taking part in tournaments plus there are tea and biscuits to enjoy. The perfect activity for people of all ages, I would definitely recommend the Mourne Archery Centre for something a bit different.</q><br>Bronagh,

      <h2 class="message-header">Covid-19 Update</h2>
      <p>We are really excited to be able to start offering sessions again from the start of August - we don't have a firm date but we are working on it. We've missed you! </p>
      <p>Obviously, we are really concerned to keep everyone as safe as possible. We will provide hand-sanitiser, clean our bows and surfaces between sessions and ask that you respect social distancing rules. Don't worry there is plenty of room in the barn!</p>
      <p>We are going to have to limit groups to 6 and offer a shorter time shooting to leave time for cleaning and preparation. Sadly we won't be able to offer tea and coffee at the moment, so please bring your own drinks. </p>
      <p>Initially, we can only offer sessions to over 12s but are working to change this as soon as possible.</p>
      <p>Stay safe and see you soon!</p>
